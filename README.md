The scenario is about "Î©mega schools" that has this online server application and 
through it teachers or the princible can access remotly and submit important data 
into the school database!

The one part of the application is the server-side, made with Express.js 
and the other part is the database shema that is made with Mysql

For the protection of the database I apply form-validation with 'express-validator'

The pages resolves dynamicly in the client with EJS

There is also a front-validation, like this a mistake in the input will stop the 
proccess on the client side and will not unjustly occupy the server.

The front-end validation is made with vanilla Jacascript
